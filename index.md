summary: Let's create 2D games using Deenight's <a href="https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase" target="_blank">gameBase</a> and  <a href="https://ldtk.io/" target="_blank">LDtk</a>, leveraging <a href="https://haxe.org/" target="_blank">Haxe</a> and <a href="https://heaps.io/" target="_blank">Heaps</a>.

## First, who am I

Nobody, really. I'm not a developer by trade, especially not a game developer.  I'll probably do stupid errors and write inefficient code, so keep it in mind and use your better judgment with this documentation :)

## What's all this?

To be honest is a bit like cheating or skipping the hard work of really learn to code. Let's call this Game dev for amatuers.
This is aimed to people who would like to create little (or big) 2D games for fun, because it's interesting, because it's a way to learn something new.

## What's gameBase?

I guess we could call gameBase a template for 2D Games, written using Haxe language and the Heaps graphics engine.

[Deepnight](https://deepnight.net/) wrote gameBase mainly for himself and because he loves [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) jams, but the source code is free and available on gitHub so we all can enjoy the work he has already done :)

## Examples

I guess the easy way to understand what is this all about is to show some games. If you like what you see and you're not afraid of a little coding, this may be perfect to create your dream game.
