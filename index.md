## First, who am I

Nobody, really. I'm not a developer by trade, especially not a game developer.  I'll probably do stupid errors and write inefficient code, so keep it in mind and use your better judgment with this documentation :)

## What's all this?

To be honest, is a bit like cheating or skipping the hard work of really learn to code. Let's call this Game dev for amateurs.
This is aimed at people who would like to create little (or big) 2D games for fun, because it's interesting because it's a way to learn something new.

## What's gameBase?

I guess we could call gameBase a template for 2D Games, written using Haxe language and the Heaps graphics engine.

[Deepnight](https://deepnight.net/) wrote gameBase mainly for himself and because he loves [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) jams, but the source code is free and available on gitHub so we all can enjoy the work he has already done :)

## What's LDtk?

[LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) is a Level Designer Toolkit and we'll use this to create our levels and our entire world.
As for gameBase it's being developed by Deepnight and it's growing into something special. Give it a try even if you don't want to use gameBase or Heaps.

## Examples

I guess the easy way to understand what is this all about is to show some games. If you like what you see and you're not afraid of a little coding, this may be perfect to create your dream game.

### Fort Loop by Deepnight

Fort Loop is a fantastic example of what can be achieved with gameBase and is pack full of great ideas, both in gameplay and in code.
It's a puzzle game created for LD47 and a must-have source code for any beginner.

Source code is as always available on [Deepnight's gitHub](https://github.com/deepnight/ld47).

### Game feel demo by Deepnight

{% include image.html file="example_gamefeel.png" url="https://deepnight.net/games/game-feel/" alt="Game feel demo" caption="Click to play the game" %}

This is not exactly an actual game. It was developed to serve as a demonstration for a “Game feel” talk in 2019 at the ENJMIN school, but it's a small little gem to explore with beautiful controls and nice physics.

### Ninja Frog by me

{% include image.html file="example_ninjafrog.png" url="https://dieffe.itch.io/ninja-frog/" alt="Ninja Frog" caption="Click to play the game" %}

Ninja Frog is my first real game and has been mainly a learning exercise for gameBase.
It's not a perfect game by any stretch, but it was fun and I enjoyed every bug, issue, and of course every little success.  

This is a small puzzle game, heavily inspired (something more than inspired I admit) by the beautiful Pixel Frog art. His demo levels are so nice, complete, and full of ideas, that I couldn't resist the urge to try to replicate at least a fraction of them on my own.
